        <p>The Marauders were a group of four Gryffindors and classmates: Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Sirius Black, and James Potter. The four attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1971-1978. They had a knack for rule-breaking and mischief-making. While at Hogwarts they also created the Marauder's Map, which continues to help future generations of mischief-makers.<br /><br />The Marauders would all go on to fight in the First Wizarding War and some in the second. They were also participants in the original Order of the Phoenix, an organisation lead by Albus Dumbledore in the struggle against the Dark Lord, Voldemort. James and Sirius were the first two friends.They met on the train to Hogwarts.James came from the pureblood Potter family and was pretty much a spoilt brat.Sirius, on the other hand, came from the purelood Black family, which saw halfbloods or muggle-borns as scum. His entire family had been in Slytherin. They bonded over the fact that they both wished to be in Gryffindor.Later, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew would join the gang.Remus had been bit by a werewolf when he was a child and every full moon he would turn into one.He kept this a secret to his friends but soon they figured it out, but instead of being scared they accepted him as who he was and would even join him on fullmoon nights.Peter on the other hand was a weak, dull,power-hungry boy.He tagged along the trio and eventually became part of them as they took pity on him.And so THE MARAUDERS were formed.<br /><br />All of the Marauders died whilst protecting Harry Potter from Voldemort or his Death Eaters but their legacy lived on through Harry, as he would name his child James Sirius Potter after his father and godfather.He would also raise Lupin's son, Teddy. They remain the only people to have managed to pull off an unregistered animagus.Sirius was the fist ever person to escape Azkaban.In the end the Marauders will be remembered as Messrs Moony,Wormtail,Padfoot and Prongs.<br>Mischief Managed!</p>
